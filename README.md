NewLife Blogger 
===============

Hello I am Nick <nick@nick.gs> and I made this thing. Newlife Blogger was a 
project I made 
several years ago as a hobby. A friend of mine wanted to offer blogging service
to his online community, and asked me to setup something. I was going to 
just use livejournal as it is an open source project, but LJ is a huge system
and I wasn't qualified to set it up and it would have been overkill anyway. So
instead I made my own simple clone of Live Journal and we called it NewLife 
Blogger after the community my friend ran.

The project is no longer maintained, but it was my first big project and I was
rather prowd of it at the time. I had to deal with managing files, validating
email addresses, banning unruly users, and letting people express themself with
custom themes. The software was used on a few other sites, the biggest was a 
gaming community that had about 3000 users.
